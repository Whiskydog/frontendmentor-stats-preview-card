## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project allowed me to really get down on Flexbox and get the hang of how modern responsive layouts are laid out (no pun intended). Still, this is a topic on which I feel I have a long way to go.

Media queries is also a subject I had to assimilate when working on this, since the card is laid out differently depending if you're on mobile or desktop.

The concept of mobile-first approach to design was also very helpful. I initially designed the desktop version but it was a whole headache when trying to make it work for mobile. I then scrapped some of my CSS and tried doing the mobile version first and everything just fit together. Check the [index.css file](./index.css) to see how simple the media query is for this!

All these are topics I want to delve deeper in looking forward!

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Kevin is a master when it comes to CSS and his videos helped me understand fundamental concepts like the Flexbox layout module, image source sets, and media queries. I wholly recommend his channel for any CSS student.
- [CSS-Tricks' A Complete Guide to Flexbox article](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - CSS-Tricks is overall a great resource for learning... well, CSS tricks! Their article on Flexbox has illustrations that really allows you to understand what each property does.
- [Refactoring UI book](https://www.refactoringui.com/) - In the "Layout and Spacing" chapter, TailwindCSS creators touch on the topic of mobile-first design very eloquently.
